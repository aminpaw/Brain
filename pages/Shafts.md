- If shafts system has multiple sized shafts, the system can be simplified to a single shaft with an equivalent length

$$
Q_e = \frac{G*d_e^4}{32L_e}, where \ d_e \ is \ any\ diameter\
$$
- To get node point :
	1- After getting the equivalent length calculate position of the node point on the simplified shaft 
	2- Convert the equivalent length back to normal length
